This program aims to facilitate the writing of several letters to the respective receivers. From a model and a database with several names, it is possible to generate all the documents, without having to type them one by one.

## Usage

You can download the project and run the main file as long as you have Python installed. Feel free to modify the invited_names.txt file with whatever names you want, as long as they are separated by a line break.
